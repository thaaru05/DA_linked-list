A critical point in a linked list is defined as a local minima. A node is a local minima if the
current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.
Note that a node can only be a local minima if there exists both a previous node and a
next node. Given a linked list head, return an array of length 2 containing [minDistance,
maxDistance] where minDistance is the minimum distance between any two distinct
critical points and maxDistance is the maximum distance between any two distinct
critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return [-1, -1].
